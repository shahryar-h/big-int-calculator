# Big Integer Calculator
* A neuromorphic designed calculator to work with long integers. Operations like adding two 20-digit numbers.

  

## Project Status
* the calculator works with four basic operations. 
* I am currently working to add some additional operations such as power and percentage.

## Example:

    1273894298346523095762084395768249375092 + 3129472903409783749832748932704790328409
    
* To perform the above operation we can't just use programming language's integer addition function. Adding the above numbers cause integer overflow. this means the operation generates a value that is outside the range that can be represented by the programming language. this calculator's algorithm makes this kind of operations possible.
